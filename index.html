      old. He studied chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, where he conducted research on proton radiography that helped a team win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985. After graduate school, Walt founded the firm Gray Matter
      Technologies with Elliott Schwartz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Godley">(Adam Godley)</a>, his former classmate and close friend.Around this time, Walt dated his lab assistant, Gretchen Schwartz
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Hecht"> (Jessica Hecht)</a>. He left both Gretchen and Gray Matter Technologies, selling his financial interest in the company for $5,000. Gretchen and Elliott later married and made a fortune,
      much of it from Walt's research. Though they remain friendly, Walt secretly resents both Gretchen and Elliott for profiting from his work.

      At the age of 50, Walt works as a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, providing instruction to uninterested and disrespectful students. Walt also has another job at a local car wash to supplement his income, which proves
      to be particularly humiliating when he has to clean the cars of his own students. Walt and his wife Skyler<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Gunn"><em>(Anna Gunn)</em> </a>have a teenage son named Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte), who has
      cerebral palsy. Skyler is also pregnant with their second child, Holly, who is born at the end of season two.Walt's other family includes Skyler's sister, Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt); her husband, Hank <a

  <h3><em>The real-life owners of the house that Walter White lived in on the show are not happy about how popular the show made their home.</em></h3>
  <P>
    <I> The filming location for Walter White's house in "Breaking Bad" became a tourism must-see in Albuquerque. But for the current occupants, the sensation around their home became so frustrating they ended up building a fence around it.

      In 2017, the homeowner's daughter Joanne Quintana told KOB4 News in Albuquerque that the number of visitors to her home was ridiculous and that she lost count of how many people would come to take a photo each week.

      She also said that tourists would do things like take rocks from her landscaping, get demanding about their photos, and even toss pizzas on the roof just like Walter White did in the now-iconic moment from the show.

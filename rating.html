      <i> It's unpredictable and stimulating, like the drug that White manufactures, but it produces a much safer high. The show tries too hard to be socially relevant, with Walt representing a desperate middle class attempt to gain footing.ts
        achievement rarely matches its ambitions, but the effect is still pretty dope.
        Breaking Bad falls around the middle of the pack in the new wave of cable dramas. But it's got a solid cast and a good upside.Cranston's performance alone is enough to keep me watching for a while, but I'd like to see something resembling a
        completed formula, and soon.
        Occasionally, something will pop up to remind us of just how good television can be when smart writers come up with an intriguing concept and execute it well.
